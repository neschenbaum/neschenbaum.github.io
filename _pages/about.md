I am a researcher and consultant at the intersection of AI, game theory, and antitrust.

I integrate AI into business practices, develop and implement computable economic models, support companies in antitrust investigations, analyze strategic behavior in energy markets, and help regulators and policymakers understand the economics of digital markets/AI. More details on my consulting work are <a href="https://neschenbaum.github.io/consulting/">here</a>.
My latest research funded by the Hasler Foundation integrates a programmatic, modular framework of game theory with machine learning libraries (<a href="https://neschenbaum.github.io/projects/2_project/">repository</a>). You can find details on my various research activities <a href="https://neschenbaum.github.io/projects/">here</a>.
